# AutoHotkey
AutoHotkey for Hub16 https://github.com/joshajohnson/Hub16/ (A macro pad with 16 keys, two rotary encoders, a four port USB hub, and plenty of LEDs!) 

I am primarly useing this as a replacement for a number pad, and media controlls. There are a few application specific configurations.
